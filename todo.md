# Tuning

spiders aren't much of a threat

# Outstanding bugs

sprites don't fade during game-over
ought to reset all player-related timers (like cooldowns) between levels/kills
cooldown should have time ADDED after it hits zero, shouldn't just jump up to full time
do we really need the strafe key?
enemy shot cooldown tracks should be randomized at spawn
you should die if you move into an enemy
